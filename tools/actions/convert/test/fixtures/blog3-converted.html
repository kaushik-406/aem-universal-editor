      <h1>Enabling Science at Scale: How Danaher Life Sciences partners deep with Biopharma</h1>

      <p>The demand for advanced therapeutics and new drug modalities is expected to explode in the coming decade. For example, more than 2,000 <a href="/us/en/library/gene-therapy.html">gene therapies</a> and modified <a href="/us/en/library/cell-therapy.html">cell therapies</a> are currently under development, along with 800-plus non-genetically modified cell therapies, according to the American Society of Gene &#x26; Cell Therapy. And the development pipeline for <a href="/us/en/library/monoclonal-antibodies-overview.html">monoclonal antibodies</a>grew about 20% in 2022 to include 140 investigational drugs, estimates the Antibody Society.</p>
      <p>While this is good news for patients awaiting treatments for complex diseases, it presents an immediate scalability challenge to biopharma leaders – one that University of Pennsylvania professor and CAR-T pioneer Dr. Carl June has referred to as a crisis waiting to happen. “My big worry is, what if we actually make … engineered cell therapies work for solid cancer?” June said during the Danaher Genomic Medicines Summit held in December 2022 in Boston. “We just couldn’t meet the demand at this point.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, biopharma leaders that are developing cell therapies and other potential cures for large patient populations will need to address bottlenecks in their research, development, and manufacturing processes to meet the expected demand.</p>
      <p>Several Life Sciences companies at Danaher Corporation, such as Molecular Devices, Leica Microsystems, SCIEX, IDBS, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Aldevron, and Cytiva, offer a wide array of products and services to support the biopharma industry at the point solution level, the automation level, and the data and digitization level. Together they help the industry to embrace an approach that combines scientific rigor with engineering know-how to create stronger innovation. This entails bolstering every stage of biopharma development with engineering principles and practices. Applying this approach will require biopharma developers to adopt automation at every stage, from early discovery through manufacturing, and to lean on artificial intelligence to improve their processes. And it will demand that best practices be industrialized to improve and accelerate the innovation of new cures.</p>
      <p>Danaher Life Sciences partners deep with biopharma companies like Sanofi to help solve the oldest and most vexing challenges in biopharma: the high rate of failure of drugs that look promising in phase 1 trials but never make it to market, and the excessive time it takes to discover new medicines and deliver them to patients.</p>
